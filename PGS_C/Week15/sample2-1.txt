TI  - Differential occupational risk for COVID-19 and other infection exposure according to race and ethnicity.
LID - 10.1002/ajim.23145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are racial and ethnic disparities in the risk of contracting COVID-19. This study sought to assess how occupational segregation according to race and ethnicity may contribute to the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: Data about employment in 2019 by industry and occupation and race and ethnicity were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. This data was combined with information about industries according to whether they were likely or possibly essential during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of exposure to infections and close proximity to others by occupation. The percentage of workers employed in essential industries and occupations with a high risk of infection and close proximity to others by race and ethnicity was calculated. RESULTS: People of color were more likely to be employed in essential industries and in occupations with more exposure to infections and close proximity to others. Black workers in particular faced an elevated risk for all of these factors. CONCLUSION: Occupational segregation into high-risk industries and occupations likely contributes to differential risk with respect to COVID-19. Providing adequate projection to workers may help to reduce these disparities.

TI  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates.
LID - hcaa202 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcaa202 [doi]
AB  - Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has profound psychological and social effects. The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Simultaneous mechanical ventilation of several patients with a single ventilator might reduce the deficit of these devices for the care of patients with acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19. OBJECTIVE: To communicate the results of a mechanical ventilation exercise with a ventilator in a lung simulator, and simultaneously in two and four. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between programmed, recorded and measured positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure and peak pressure, except when simultaneously ventilating four lung simulators. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous mechanical ventilation should be implemented by medical personnel with experience in the procedure, be restricted to two patients and carried out in the intensive care unit.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As of March 23, 2020, suspension of non-essential activities was declared in Mexico throughout the country in order to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To analyze data on the first 1,510 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to describe the geographical distribution of the disease and its transmission dynamics. METHOD: Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic. RESULTS: Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males, 44 % of initial cases were imported. Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases, however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.

AB  - Except for pregnant women, the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic includes the standard procedures that are used for any patient that requires to be attended to at the intensive care unit, as well as limited administration of crystalloid solutions, orotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation in the event of patient clinical deterioration, and muscle relaxants continuous infusion only if necessary. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation and high-flow oxygen therapy are not recommended due to the generation of aerosol (associated with risk of viral spread among health personnel), and neither is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or the use of steroids. So far, there is no specific antiviral treatment for patients with COVID-19, and neither are there results of controlled trials supporting the use of any.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding at an unprecedented pace. The unprecedented threat provides an opportunity to emerge with robust health systems. Nepal has implemented several containment measures such as Rapid Response Team formulation, testing, isolation, quarantine, contact tracing,surveillance, establishment of COVID-19 Crisis Management Centre and designation of dedicated hospitals to gear up for the pandemic. The national public health emergency management mechanisms need further strengthening with the proactive engagement of relevant ministries, we need a strong, real-time national surveillance system and capacity building of a critical mass of health care workers, there is a need to further assess infection prevention and control capacity, expand the network of virus diagnostic laboratories in the private sector with adequate surge capacity,implement participatory community engagement interventions and plan for a phased lockdown exit strategy enabling sustainable suppression of transmission at low-level and enabling in resuming some parts of economic and social life.

LID - 10.3233/XST-200687 [doi]
AB  - Recently, COVID-19 has spread in more than 100 countries and regions around the world, raising grave global concerns. COVID-19 transmits mainly through respiratory droplets and close contacts, causing cluster infections. The symptoms are dominantly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, and can be complicated with tiredness, sore throat, and headache. A few of patients have symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose, and diarrhea. The severe disease can progress rapidly into the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Next-generation sequencing (NGS) are the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Chest imaging is used for cross validation. Chest CT is highly recommended as the preferred imaging diagnosis method for COVID-19 due to its high density and high spatial resolution. The common CT manifestation of COVID-19 includes multiple segmental ground glass opacities (GGOs) distributed dominantly in extrapulmonary/subpleural zones and along bronchovascular bundles with crazy paving sign and interlobular septal thickening and consolidation. Pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rarely seen. In CT imaging, COVID-19 manifests differently in its various stages including the early stage, the progression (consolidation), and the absorption. In its early stage, it manifests as scattered flaky GGOs in various sizes, dominated by peripheral pulmonary zone/subpleural distributions. In the progression state, GGOs increase in number and/or size, and lung consolidations may become visible. The main manifestation in the absorption stage is interstitial change of both lungs, such as fibrous cords and reticular opacities. Differentiation between COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral pneumonias are also analyzed. Thus, CT examination can help reduce false negatives of nucleic acid tests.

LID - 10.3233/JPD-202109 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has driven rapid, widespread adoption of telemedicine. The distribution of clinicians, long travel distances, and disability all limit access to care, especially for persons with Parkinson's disease. Telemedicine is not a panacea for all of these challenges but does offer advantages. These advantages can be summarized as the 5 C's: accessible care, increased convenience, enhanced comfort, greater confidentiality to patients and families, and now reduced risk of contagion. Telemedicine also has its limitations, including the inability to perform parts of the physical examination and inequitable access to the Internet and related technologies. Future models will deliver care to patients from a diverse set of specialties. These will include mental health specialists, physiotherapists, neurosurgeons, speech-language therapists, dieticians, social workers, and exercise coaches. Along with these new care models, digital therapeutics, defined as treatments delivered through software programs, are emerging. Telemedicine is now being introduced as a bridge to restart clinical trials and will increasingly become a normal part of future research studies. From this pandemic will be a wealth of new telemedicine approaches which will fundamentally change and improve care as well as research for individuals with Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures are some of the neurological complications in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2). There remains a challenge to determine the extent to which neurological abnormalities in COVID-19 are caused by SARS-Cov2 itself, the exaggerated cytokine response it triggers, and/or the resulting hypercoagulapathy and formation of blood clots in blood vessels throughout the body and the brain. In this article, we review the reports that address neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, who may present with acute neurological symptoms (e.g., stroke), even without typical respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Next, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms that may underlie the link between SARS-Cov2 and COVID-19 in the brain, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Finally, we propose a basic "NeuroCovid" classification scheme that integrates these concepts and highlights some of the short-term challenges for the practice of neurology today and the long-term sequalae of COVID-19 such as depression, OCD, insomnia, cognitive decline, accelerated aging, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease in the future. In doing so, we intend to provide a basis from which to build on future hypotheses and investigations regarding SARS-Cov2 and the nervous system.

TI  - Dementia Care in Times of COVID-19: Experience at Fundacio ACE in Barcelona, Spain.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-200547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fundacio ACE is a non-profit organization providing care based on a holistic model to persons with cognitive disorders and their families for 25 years in Barcelona, Spain. Delivering care to this vulnerable population amidst the COVID-19 pandemic has represented a major challenge to our institution. OBJECTIVE: To share our experience in adapting our model of care to the new situation to ensure continuity of care. METHODS: We detail the sequence of events and the actions taken within Fundacio ACE to swiftly adapt our face-to-face model of care to one based on telemedicine consultations. We characterize individuals under follow-up by the Memory Unit from 2017 to 2019 and compare the number of weekly visits in 2020 performed before and after the lockdown was imposed. RESULTS: The total number of individuals being actively followed by Fundacio ACE Memory Unit grew from 6,928 in 2017 to 8,147 in 2019. Among those newly diagnosed in 2019, most patients had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (42% and 25%, respectively). Weekly visits dropped by 60% following the suspension of face-to-face activity. However, by April 24 we were able to perform 78% of the visits we averaged in the weeks before confinement began. DISCUSSION: We have shown that Fundacio ACE model of care has been able to successfully adapt to a health and social critical situation as COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we were able to guarantee the continuity of care while preserving the safety of patients, families, and professionals. We also seized the opportunity to improve our model of care.

AB  - There are a number of potential implications for the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) stemming from the global spread of SARS-CoV-2. Neuroinflammation is known to be a prominent feature of neurodegeneration and plays a major role in AD pathology. Immune response and excessive inflammation in COVID-19 may also accelerate the progression of brain inflammatory neurodegeneration, and elderly individuals are more susceptible to severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk for AD as well as severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genetic and socioeconomic factors influencing the rates of T2D, AD, and COVID-19 severity may create an exceptionally high-risk profile for certain demographics such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Type I interferon response plays an important role in both host response to viral infection, as well as AD pathology and may be a sensible therapeutic target in both AD and COVID-19.

TI  - Herd immunity or suppression strategy to combat COVID-19.
LID - 10.3233/CH-209006 [doi]
AB  - Some months ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly around the world. Some states, such as the Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden and the USA initially focused on keeping the restrictions for economy and society as low as possible. The responsible authorities were of the opinion - and still are e.g. in Sweden - that it is sufficient enough to protect particularly vulnerable persons such as the elderly or people with pre-existing conditions. The idea behind this is that as soon as 60 to 70 percent of the population is infected with a pathogen, a so-called "herd immunity" has developed. However, the increasing numbers of deaths and modelling studies showed the expected overload of the hospitals. Therefore, most countries decided for a temporary lockdown with the exception of Sweden.Based on the number of the total population, three times more people died from COVID-19 in Sweden (2679 deaths per 10 million inhabitants) compared to Germany (6848 deaths per 80 million inhabitants). The comparison Sweden versus Taiwan is even worse because 1072 times more people died in Sweden based on the number of the population (6 deaths per 24 million inhabitants).In the face of the lack of an antiviral treatment and the lack of a protective vaccine one must state Taiwan has made the best out of the pandemic situation whereas Sweden failed completely.

TI  - Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to assess pleural pulmonal changes in severe Covid 19 infection: First results.
LID - 10.3233/CH-209005 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in severe cases of Covid-19 infection to assess pulmonary changes near the pleura. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bedside examinations by an experienced intensive care unit examiner using a multi-frequency probe (C1-6 MHz) with B-mode and CEUS to assess pleural-near changes in severe cases of Covid-19 infection with respiratory failure. CEUS with bolus delivery via a central venous catheter of 2.4 ml Sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles from the arterial phase (10-15 s) to the late phase of 5 min. Digital storage of cine sequences of the lung sound with abdomen for independent assessment with the subsequently performed contrast-enhanced dual-source CT. RESULTS: In 11 intubated and ventilated patients (arithmetic mean 62 years, 48 to 78 years, 3 women) with confirmed severe COVID-19 infections, a peripherally accentuated consolidation with irregular hyperemia was found in the CEUS and also in the CT examination. Of the 5 cases with pulmonary arterial embolisms, signs of right ventricular failure were found. In all cases, using CEUS low perfused areas of the pleura with adjacent hyperemia could be detected, while with CT segmental contrast medium gaps with subpleural compressions were found. Interstitial changes near the pleura led to B-lines and to ground glass opacities in the CT. Near the diaphragm a delayed arterial contrast of the liver was observed. In addition, in 2 cases partial atelectasis, in 3 cases marginal pleural effusions were found. CONCLUSION: CEUS opens up new possibilities for bedside monitoring of pleural reactive inflammatory or peripheral thrombus embolism in severe cases of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - The Goddess of Health had two daughters, Panacea and Higinia, the fruit of the first is diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and the fruit of the second is health management, prevention, and statistics. Humanbeings are unexpectedly subjected to:1. Happenings: they belong to the plane of the personality, crisis, the Age of the virus appears that had already been announced. The ideological support is not sustained, causing a bankruptcy in the system of our life. The subject acts unconsciously, does not believe in the advent of the catastrophe, does not follow logical rules, is unable to transcend, fear-anguish appears and this requires a lot of protection. Those who remain free from personal decomposition skewer him and put a project called "person" with his sense of life, his lifestyle and life project, which is the conjunction of body and spirit, which with the agony struggles against life itself.2. Events: they belong to the plane of nature, catastrophes. The use of the word catastrophe is not synonymou swith unavoidable natural disaster, accident, although it is used by the health authorities this can have a great impact on those affected by the virus. This word has the final nuance of Greek tragedies. False arrogance appears, true madness. In the case of the Covid-19 there is something else, a dialectical position with oneself. They lived and we lived on a volcano. The example of the Apocalypse and its three plagues, epidemics and post-war neuroses, etc. The most striking neuropsychiatricsymptomatology is the appearance of "ageusia" and "anosmia", abruptly and totally, which disappears slowly, as well as sleep disturbances with ignagogic images post-traumatic stress charts appear.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 in spanish urology residents: Recommendations and perspective.
PG  - 471-478
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously disrupted the day-to-day running of hospitals, affecting the activity of all medical and surgical departments. It has also affected urology residents, depriving them of training at their usual workplaces and forcing them to support COVID units. This has implied not only the loss of daily activities, but also the uncertainty of job opportunities for the final year residents. In addition, the cancellation of numerous events such as congresses, exams,or courses has affected the annual planning of the specialty. A review of the current literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the de-escalation process, on resident training has been carried out using web search and PubMed. The situation of the residents has been analyzed, both through the information generated by recent literature and by the personal experience of the authors, from different areas: evaluation systems, educational and surgical aspects, as well as healthcare work. As a result of this review, the negative impact of the crisison urology resident training can be observed, especially in the surgical field, but new learning opportunities or new forms of communication with the patient can also be observed. These educational and healthcare resources invite the urology resident in particular, and the medical society in general, to reinvent themselves. The aim of this article is to analyse the training of the urology resident in the de-escalation phase. Similarly, the emerging educational resources during the pandemic are synthesized, inviting the reader, and especially the urology resident, to continue their training and learningin these times of uncertainty.

TI  - [Robotic and laparosocpic urological surgery during COVID-19 pandemia.].
PG  - 463-470
AB  - OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hashigh repercussion on urologic minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Controversy about safety of MIS procedures during COVID-19 pandemic has been published. Nowadays, our priority should be create agreement in order to restart and organize MIS with safety conditions for patients and healthcare workers. METHODS: Pubmed and web search was conducted with following terms: "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID19", "COVID19 Urology", COVID19 Surgery", "COVID19 transmission", "SARS-CoV-2 transmission", "COVID19 nd minimally invasive surgery", "SARS-CoV-2 and CO 2insuflation". A narrative review of available literature and scientific evidence summary was done. A modify nominal group technique was used to achieve an expert consensus. First draft was circulated amongst authors. Definitive document was approved in May 26th. RESULTS: Non evidence supports higher risk of SARSCoV-2 healthcare workers infection with MIS compared to open surgery. MIS is associated with shorter hospital stay than open surgery. Modify MIS indications to open surgery, with no scientific evidence, could spend valuable resources in detriment to COVID-19 patients. MIS indications should be prioritized attending to available resources and pandemic intensity. SARS-CoV-2screening 72 hours prior to surgery by clinical and epidemiological questionnaire and nasopharyngeal PCRis recommended, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission, professional infections and to minimize postoperative complications. Intraoperative steps should be established to reduce professional exposure to surgical aerosols, including: surgical room reorganization, adequate personal protective equipment, surgical technique optimization and management of CO2 and surgical smoke. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 pandemic de-escalation, MIS carried out with optimal safety measurements, could contribute to reduce hospital resources utilization. With current evidence, MIS should not be limited or reconverted to open surgery during COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - [Impact of COVID-19 during de-escalation in pediatric urology.].
PG  - 455-462
AB  - Medical and surgical priorities have changed dramatically following the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. The rapid spread of the virus and the high number of cases has saturated the health system in our country and has forced many hospitals to redistribute resources to care for infected patients. This has led to asignificant reduction in surgical activity, in some cases reaching the point of delaying all elective interventions by performing only urgent interventions. The decrease in the number of infections with the progressive desaturation of hospitals has currently allowed us to enter a new phase of "de-escalation" or transition in order to recover our surgical activity in pediatric urology, which was practically canceled. It is proposed how surgical care activities such as outpatient care should be deal twith, in addition to the different circuits that patients must maintain and, above all, their and professional safety.

TI  - [Renal transplantation during COVID-19 period in Spain.].
PG  - 447-454
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges in the area of kidney donation and transplantation. The objective of this article is to establish general recommendations for surgical teams to manage the kidney transplant program duringthe COVID-19 era. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This document is based on the scientific evidence available on the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the experience of authors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web and Pubmed search was performed using the keywords "SARS-CoV-2"," COVID-19", "COVID Urology", "COVID-19 surgery", and "kidney transplantation." A modified nominal group technique was used. RESULTS: When health system saturation occurs, kidney transplants should be deferred, except in patients with low transplant possibilities and an optimal kidney available, combined transplants or life-threatening situations. Screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be done in all those donors and recipients with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19, who have visited or live inhigh-risk areas, or who have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Donation and transplantation will not proceed in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Surgeries should be based on general recommendations in the COVID-19 era and will be efficient, short, and focused on those with the shortest hospital stay. In emergencies, protective measures will be taken with persona lprotection equipment. Surgical staff will be only the strictly necessary, and permanence in the OR should be minimized. Transplant urology consultations will be conducted by teleconsultation when possible. CONCLUSION: The safety of potential donors and recipients must be guaranteed, adopting individual protection measures and screening for SARS-CoV-2. Kidney transplant surgery must be efficient in terms of health, human resources, and clinical benefit. All non-urgent transplant activities should be delayed until the improvement of the local condition of each center.

PG  - 429-437
AB  -  To report the recommendations of an expert panel to reorganize Neurourology units and to prioritize examinations and both conservative and surgical treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-systematic review of the literature and national experts' opinion summarizing the recommendations in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of neurourological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified nominal group technique was used due to extraordinary meeting and mobility restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Neurourological patients have special physiological and pathological characteristics that make them more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For prioritization purposes, they encompass in Functional Urology patients and their management is considered non-urgentor delayable with no specific deadline of recovery from normality. However, it is important to identify individual situations jeopardising the upper urinary tract, urinary retention or predisposing to urinary infections/sepsis. A classification is provided prioritizing conservative/outpatient management and the surgical treatment of the events occurring in neurourological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In neurourological patients we can find exceptional clinical situations in which a delayed treatment could develop irreversible changes in the upper urinary tract, advocating a more urgent treatment inspecific scenarios.

TI  - [Functional urology during COVID-19: Recommendations during de-escalation.].
PG  - 420-428
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, all surgical activity that was not life threatening was cancelled , as well as most face-to-face consultations. Currently the beginning of the de-escalation phases that will led us to a new normal, forces us to establish some degree of priority in the interventions as well as in the medical consultations. Our objective is to establish some recommendation on Functional Urology office visits and surgical interventions that serve as a tool to facilitate decision-making. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experts in Functional Urology from different autonomous communities of Spain were contacted to design a strategy to reorganize the activity of both, diagnosis and treatment. A modified nominal group technique has been used due to the extraordinary restrictions of assembly and mobility during the COVID pandemic. The first signer (EMC) made the first draft with the measures adopted and the strategy to be followed during the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal was sent to the rest of the authors, in order to unify criteria and experiences to reach a quick consensus on the relative priority of the different activities, problems and solutions. A final version was approved by all authors May 27, 2020. RESULTS: Tables of recommendation have been prepared for outpatient consultation, surgical and technical interventions, according to de-escalation phases proposed by the Spanish Associations of Surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: The change that COVID-19 Pandemich as involved in our clinical practice force us to seek alternative methods to treat our patients, some of which may already be established. Mean while, a consensusin decision making is necessary. Documents such as the current one, are intended to guide the management of patients with urological functional pathology in exceptional situations. Logically, it should be adapted to material and human availability, and to the idiosyncrasy of each Urology service.

TI  - [Reconstructive surgery protocol recommendations during COVID-19 pandemia.].
PG  - 413-419
AB  - Offer some recommendations or guidelines during the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of diagnosis, treatment and follow-upin the field of Reconstructive Urology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The document is based on the evidence on SARS/Cov-2 and the authors' experience in managing COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Madrid, Cantabria,the Valencian Community and Catalonia. A web and PubMed search was performed using "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Urology", "COVID19 urology complications", "COVID-19 reconstructive surgery".A narrative review of the literature was carried out (5/17/2020) and after the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria and reach a quick consensus. Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors (5/22/2020). RESULTS: The authors defined the following surgical priorities for Urological Reconstructive Surgery: Emergency/Urgency (life-threatening or emergencies still in anormal situation), Elective Urgency/High priority (potentially dangerous pathology if postponed for more than 1month), Elective Surgery/Intermediate priority (pathology with little probability of being dangerous but it is recommended not to delay more than 6 months), Delayed surgery/Low priority (non-dangerous pathology if it is postponed for more than 6 months). According to this classification, the Working Group agreed on the distribution of the different surgical scenarios of Reconstructive Urology. In addition, consensus was reached on recommendations regarding the diagnosis and follow-up of pathology in the field of Reconstructive Urology. CONCLUSIONS: Tools should be implemented to facilitate the gathering of the medical visit and diagnostic tests. Redistribution of surgical procedures based on priority degrees is necessary during the pandemic and transition period. The use of telemedicine is essential forfollow-up, by computer, telephone or videoconference.

PG  - 395-404
AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic which has affected Spain since the beginning of 2020 compels us to determine recomendations for the practice of Andrology in present times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web search is carried out in English and Spanish and a joint proposal is defined by experts in Andrology from different regions of Spain. RESULTS: Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in Andrology can be safey postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online consultations and outpatient surgeries must be encouraged. Andrologic emergencies and penile cancer management should be considered high priority, and should be diagnosed and treated promptly even in the most severe phases of the pandemic.

TI  - [Benign prostatic hyperplasia management during COVID-19 pandemia.].
PG  - 405-412
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The pandemic caused by the new SARS / Cov-2 Coronavirus represents an unprecedented scenario in modern medicine that affects many aspects of daily healthcare. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has a high prevalence and is related to high consumption of health resources. For this reason, we performed a revision of the management of LUTS and HBP during and after COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of experts in benign prostatic hyperplasia from different regions of Spain were selected to design a strategy to reorganize the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms during the pandemic. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken and a set of recommendations are generated. RESULTS: Recommendations for the management of LUTS-BPH during and after the SARS/CoV2 coronavirus pandemic outbreak consist of promoting telemedicine and developing joint protocols with Primary Care Attention .Clear diagnostic and treatment criteria and referral criteria must be established. Referral of patients for risk complications such as kidney failure, recurrent hematuria and obstructive uropathy are a priority. Surgeries due to BPH are generally potentially delayed until phases I and II of the pandemic, in which the percentage of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 does not exceed 25%, and it is necessary to determine COVID19 negativity. The surgical technique that associates the least complications and the shortest stay should be selected. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and prescription of treatment for BPH during the COVID-19 pandemic should be based on telemedicine and joint protocols for primary care attention and urology. Elective surgical treatment can be delayed until we are in phases I or II, individualizing the surgical and anaesthetic technique of choice to minimize risks.

TI  - [De-escalation: Testicular cancer.].
PG  - 390-394
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a priority algorithm for determinate diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up procedures regarding at testicular cancer, adjusted by institutional requirements. Testicular cancer patient assessment during COVID-19 Pandemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of relevant manuscript published up to date, draft creation correctedt hough modified nominal group until final corrected manuscript. RESULTS: A lack of scientific evidence exists through a large amount of manuscripts. The authors support prioritizing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Once priorities have been established, that will facilitate providing each patients the limited resources. Initial diagnostic procedures for testicular cancer such as scrotal US, orchiectomy, staging CT and adjuvant treatment (if required) are priority. Reducing the usage of chemotherapy with respiratory toxicity and increasing the usage ofgrowth factors during chemotherapy treatment are the main stakeholders of treatment. Besides, providing active surveillance on non-risk factor clinical stage I is alsoa priority. In case of positive COVID-19, it is important to high light that the vast majority of patients are tentatively cured. CONCLUSIONS: During de-escalation phases, patients diagnosed with testicular cancer should receive priority care during initial assessment. The follow-ups of patients with low -risk and without recurrence for a long time, might be delayed.

TI  - [Current status for urpper tract transitional cell carcinoma during COVID-19 pandemia.].
PG  - 384-389
AB  - First cases of COVID-19 were reported in China on December 2019 and rapidly spread globally. The explosive increase in number of cases requiring hospitalization has led to a delay in a big number of surgical interventions, including oncologic surgeries. Collateral effects of this increase means a challenge for urologists, who have been forced to redistribute their resources. Due to its poor pronostic, patients suffering from by upper tract urinary tumours will be negatively affected by this pandemic. METHODS: A non sistematic review was performed using literature published until May 23, 2020, using "Uppertract urothelial tumours", "COVID-19" and "nephroureterectomy".as keywords. The resulting manuscript was critically revised by national authors in order to establish common criteria about treatment and follow up. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four studies were identified that assessed the impact of delaying radical nephrouretrectomy as curative treatment. These studies showed that surgery delays decrease overall survival and cancer specific survival rates in high-risk groups. On the other hand, delaying radical nephrouretrectomy due to ureteroscopy did not affect survival in cohorts of patients with predominately low-grade disease. CONCLUSIONS: A delay in curative treatment of upper tract urothelial tumours for more than three months results in adverse outcomes as overal survival and cancer specific survival. Hence, it is important to prioritize the timely care of this group of patients as far as COVID-19 pandemic allows it.

PG  - 374-383
AB  - The guidelines and recommendation sof good clinical practice have been disrupted by new and urgent policies, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Urothelial carcinoma has a significant prevalence in Spain, whose population has been greatly affected by COVID-19, directly by the disease and indirectly by the confinement. The objective of this work is to offer recommendations on protocols and guidelines adjusted to different phases of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This document on the management of bladder carcinoma is based on few evidence on urological oncological practice during the first months of the pandemic and on the authors' experience in this pathology during the crisis of COVID-19. Hospital experts in infectious disseases and radiology have participated to design a common strategy to reorganize the activity. RESULTS: Different proposals for treatment and follow-up of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer adjusted for oncological risk and the different phases of the pandemic are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic's spread was unimaginable just a few months ago. Health systems have been shaken by the disease in the most critical phases. It is necessary, at this time, to make an additional effort to develop tools that can facilitate the care of bladder carcinoma and minimize the impact and risks for patients and health professionals in the future.

PG  - 367-373
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this publicationis to provide recommendations in the management of prostate cancer (PC) in a new reality framework based on the presence of COVID-19 disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The document is based on the scarce evidence on SARS/Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in handling COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Catalonia, Madrid and the Valencian Community. RESULTS: The authors defined different priorities for the different clinical situations in PC. Emergency/urgency (life-threatening or urgent even in normal situation), highpriority/elective urgency (potentially dangerous if postponed for more than 1 month), intermediate/electivepriority (it is recommended not to delay more than 6 months), low priority/delayed (can be postponed more than 6 months). According to this classification, the working panel agreed on the distribution of the different diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up scenarios for PC. The risk of severe morbidity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection may out weigh the risk of PC morbidity/mortalityin many men, therefore, in the short term it is unlikely that delays in diagnosis or treatment can led to worse cancer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a challenge for our health system, which raises several considerations in the treatment of patients with PC. The redistribution of surgical procedures according to the degrees of priority is essential during the period of the pandemic and the transition to the new normality. The change of the out-clinics with the adequate security measures for healthcare practitioners and patients, andt he development of a telemedicine program is highly recommended.

TI  - Renal cell carcinoma and COVID-19 pandemia: Management strategies adapted to current practice.
PG  - 360-366
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an important health impact that has affected renal cell carcinoma management, among other urology areas. The high cancellation rate of surgeries, including those related to renal cancer, will cause an inevitable healthcare overload and probably a potential negative impact on its oncological outcomes, especially in locally advanced and metastatic renal cancer. Kidney cancer scenarios are quite different depending on their stage, distinguishing mainly between low priority of localized disease or high priority of locally advanced and metastatic under active treatment. The unknown pandemic duration and possibly fluctuating prevalence of the virus are likely to force an adaptation in the management of renal cell carcinoma among urology and oncology departments, ideally individualized ona case-by-case basis within multidisciplinary units. To this end, we present algorithms and tables regarding renal cell carcinoma management adapted to the COVID-19 period and stratified according to oncological stage, which might be useful for specialists dedicated to this uro-oncology area.

PG  - 353-359
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The crisis in the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus causing COVID-19 is putting health systems around the world to the test. In a great effort to standardize the management and treatment guidelines, the different health authorities and scientific associations have tried to issue recommendations on how to act in this new and complex scenario. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the existing evidence and recommendations about urological emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Furthermore, we propose a general action protocol for these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The document is based ont he scarce evidence on SARS / Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in the management of COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Madrid and the Basque Country. A web and PubMed search was performed using the keywords "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID19",  "COVID Urology", "COVID19 surgery" and "emergency care". A narrative review of the literature was carried out until April 30, 2020, including only articles and documents written in Spanish and English. After the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria. Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors on May 12, 2020. RESULTS: General principles of action are set out, as well as specific recommendations for the most frequent urgent urological procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Given the exceptional nature of the situation, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of the patient with urgent urological pathology. The information is changing, as the epidemiological knowledge of the disease advances. The establishment of multidisciplinary surgical committees that develop and implement action protocols appropriate to the different resources and particular situations of each center is recommended. Likewise, these committees must individually assess each possible urological surgical emergency situation and ensure compliance with protective measures for the patient and other healthcare personnel.

TI  - [Implementation of Remote Clinics in urology practice during the COVID-19 era: What have we learned?].
PG  - 345-352
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has requiredd rastic measures for an attempt in controlling its spread. Health resources and facilities are being destined for the treatment of critically ill infected patients. During the past weeks, we, as urologists have faced increasingly difficult changes in practice, as out patient activity and elective surgeries must be postponed in order to save resources and limit the mobilization of patients and faculty. During this conflictive situation, telehealth medicine can provide adequate support using technological tools and trying to simulate face-to-face consults with the use of video or telephone calls. However, many out patient clinics and facilities are not ready yet for telehealth as their experience in this area is low. The benefits for telemedicine in urology are continuing urologic outpatient follow-up, providing recommendations and prescriptions, and the triage of patients who will need urgent procedures. Urology residency training has suffered an abrupt disruption nowadays as outpatient, surgical and academic meetings are cancelled. In this scenario, virtual strategies and "smart learning" activities are being used to continue education. We provide a review of the latest published literature regarding the use of telehealth medicine or telemedicine for the modern urology practice, along side our recommendations and conclusions.

PG  - 336-344
AB  - INTRODUCTION: On 11th March 2020the WHO declared COVID19 a global pandemic, a challenge previously unseen for sanitary systems, including the activity in Urology departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Web and PubMed searchusing the keywords "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID19", "COVID Urology", "COVID surgery", "consensus methods","nominal group", "Delphi method". A narrative revision of the literature until the 20th May 2020, including articles and documents in English and Spanish.,RESULTS: Medical practice in Spain has been forced to rapidly adapt to the pandemic, dedicating most ofits material and human resources to the care of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. This has meant a significant reduction of the routine practice in Urology, as in other medical specialities, limiting the medical attention tourgent and emergent cases. Programmed activity has been reserved for selected cases in which a delayed attention could compromise survival. Different scientific associations have made a significant effort to adapt their recommendations to the pandemic, prioritizing high-risk oncologic cases, and reducing the use of ventilators and hospital stays to the minimum. These restrictions must be dynamic, adapting to the de-escalating phases as the pandemic is more controlled, widening the range of services available. In this de-escalate there is an additional challenge, being the difficulty in generating quality scientific evidence. In order to obtain such evidence, consensus methods have been used, such as the nominal group technique or the Delphi method. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has meant a complete disruption in the routine activity in Urologyin Spain, with a need for prioritizing the attention of urgent and high-risk oncologic pathology. These restrictions must be progressively modified according to the de-escalating process in the general population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the organization of a hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, paying attention to both organizational and leadership aspects, and considering all hospital areas, including the operating room.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of the literatureregarding the organizational councils for hospital management within the pandemic. In addition, the recommendations of societies, institutions such as the WHO, the CDC, the ECDC, the National Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health of Madrid and the center's own experience have been taken into account. RESULTS: Description of the key elements for the organization,as well as the different areas of action within a hospital: emergencies, consultations, hospitalization and operating rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Management during a pandemic requires a high degree of agility in response and plasticity in people. All hospital structures must adapt to a situationfor which they have not been conceived and all staff must place themselves at the service of a disease that conditions all decisions. Being able to adapt and try to anticipate what is going to happen are the keys to success.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many. Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1,893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women's representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.

TI  - Combating sars-cov-2 through lipoxins, proteasome, caveolin and nuclear factor-κb pathways in non-pregnant and pregnant populations.
PG  - 221-229
AB  - It can be misleading to think that the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) which has a very strong mutation and adaptation capabilities, uses only the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) pathway to reach target cells. Despite all the precautions taken, the pandemic attack continues and the rapid increase in the number of deaths suggest that this virus has entered the cell through different pathways and caused damage through different mechanisms. The main reason why the ACE2 pathway comes to the fore in all scientific studies is that this receptor is located at the entry point of basic mechanisms that provide alveolo-capillary homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 has to use nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB), caveloae, clathrin, lipoxin, serine protease and proteasome pathways in addition to ACE2 to enter the target cell and initiate damage. For this reason, while new drug development studies are continuing, in order to be beneficial to patients in their acute period, it is imperative that we are able to come up with drugs that activate or inhibit these pathways and are currently in clinical use. It is also critical that we adopt these new pathways to the treatment of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2, based on the scientific data we use to treat the general population.

TI  - Molecular simulation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to pangolin ACE2 or human ACE2 natural variants reveals altered susceptibility to infection.
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.001452 [doi]
AB  - We constructed complex models of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to pangolin or human ACE2, the receptor for virus transmission, and estimated the binding free energy changes using molecular dynamics simulation. SARS-CoV-2 can bind to both pangolin and human ACE2, but has a significantly lower binding affinity for pangolin ACE2 due to the increased binding free energy (9.5 kcal mol(-1)). Human ACE2 is among the most polymorphous genes, for which we identified 317 missense single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) from the dbSNP database. Three SNVs, E329G (rs143936283), M82I (rs267606406) and K26R (rs4646116), had a significant reduction in binding free energy, which indicated higher binding affinity than wild-type ACE2 and greater susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection for people with them. Three other SNVs, D355N (rs961360700), E37K (rs146676783) and I21T (rs1244687367), had a significant increase in binding free energy, which indicated lower binding affinity and reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

LID - 10.1037/tra0000771 [doi]
AB  - Holocaust survivors in Israel and abroad appear to be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their early life history, advanced age, and associated health conditions. And although some survivors may experience retraumatization because of the pandemic, others appear to be especially resilient. We encourage a strength-based approach when working with survivors to foster resilience and effective coping in this uncertain time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

LID - 10.1037/tra0000685 [doi]
AB  - Amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, resilience is likely to be one of the many possible outcomes. Studies pertaining to resilience following potentially traumatic events including disease outbreak have shown that the vast majority of individuals are resilient, and that outcomes depend on a combination of resilience factors including exposure severity, individual differences, family context, and community characteristics. To better understand psychological dysfunction and resilience during the global outbreak of COVID-19, researchers are encouraged to investigate long-term patterns of mental health rather than cross-sectional prevalence rates, adopt prospective designs and analyses, integrate multiple risk and resilience factors to enhance outcome prediction, and consider the importance of flexibility as the situation unfolds.

LID - 10.1037/tra0000943 [doi]
AB  - By the end of March 2020, Spain was one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This commentary provides an initial picture of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak during its initial stage in Spain. Data of 3055 participants aged 18-88 years old were collected over a week (March 17th-24th 2020) using an online forms platform. Participants provided information regarding sociodemographic data and completed the Spanish version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, which assesses psychological distress caused by a traumatic life event in terms of three symptomatic responses (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal). Results revealed that 36.6% of participants showed psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Avoidance was the most prevalent symptom in the total sample and for all genders studied. The psychological impact was consistently higher for young people, and for women compared to men. Our data confirm the great psychological toll that the COVID-19 crisis took on the Spanish general population during the first week of confinement. Women and young people seem particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - Fear, anger and hopelessness were the most frequent traumatic emotional responses in the general public during the first stage of outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic (N = 1,000). The four most frequent categories of fear were determined: (a) fear of the negative impact on household finances, (b) fear of the negative impact on the household finances of significant others, (c) fear of the unavailability of health care, and (d) fear of an insufficient food supply. The pessimistic communications used by the Czech mass media contributed to intensifying traumatic feelings, fears and psychological distress in the general public during the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - This commentary describes the religiously innovative adaptations made to customary rituals by Jewish religious leaders to address issues of belonging and resilience during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic quarantine. These adaptations included allowing religious prayer through a "balcony" minyan, conducting an online chavruta using video conferencing, and broadcasting the Passover ceremony. The approach shown here could contribute to future evidence-based research, conducted among different faiths, about the roles of both religious leadership and information and communications technology (ICT) in preserving one's sense of belonging and resilience in times of crisis.

Two hundred ninety-three Israeli participants completed a Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, a Distress Thermometer, and a Perceived Stress Scale. People placed on furlough (unpaid leave of absence) by their employers demonstrated significantly higher distress (M = 5.34) than those who were unemployed prior to the pandemic (M = 3.79). The implications and coping modes with these results are detailed herein. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Leveraging parent-child interaction therapy and telehealth capacities to address the unique needs of young children during the COVID-19 public health crisis.
LID - 10.1037/tra0000863 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 and related efforts to mitigate its spread have dramatically transformed the structure and predictability of modern childhood, resulting in growing concerns children may be particularly vulnerable to serious mental health consequences. Worldwide stay-at-home directives and emergency changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement have smoothed the trail for broad implementation of technology-based remote mental health services for children. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is particularly well-positioned to address some of the most pressing child and parental needs that arise during stressful times, and telehealth formats of PCIT, such as Internet-delivered PCIT (iPCIT), have already been supported in controlled trials. This commentary explores PCIT implementation during the COVID-19 public health crisis and the challenges encountered in the move toward Internet-delivered services.

TI  - Flattening the emotional distress curve: A behavioral health pandemic response strategy for COVID-19.
LID - 10.1037/amp0000694 [doi]
AB  - This article proposes a framework for managing the behavioral health impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic. This framework aligns and should be integrated with an existing public health pandemic intervals model. It includes six phases of a behavioral health pandemic response strategy: preplanning, response readiness, response mobilization, intervention, continuation, and amelioration. The ways behavioral health specialists can capitalize on their competence in the leadership, prevention, education, service, research, and advocacy domains within each behavioral health pandemic response phase are articulated. Behavioral health expertise can help ensure a more comprehensive, effective pandemic response that facilitates the flattening of the curve of disease spread, along with the corresponding emotional distress curve. A case illustration, the Caring Communities (CC) initiative, is offered as an exemplar of action steps in the leadership, prevention, education, service, research, and advocacy domains that behavioral health professionals can take within each of the behavioral health pandemic response phases. Key CC action steps include providing support groups, offering virtual wellness breaks, participating in educational outreach, creating and disseminating wellness guides, launching and leading a virtual behavioral health clinic for health care staff, participating in behavioral health research and program evaluation, and engaging in advocacy initiatives aimed at improving behavioral health care and addressing and reducing health disparities. Finally, recommendations for optimizing behavioral health contributions to future pandemic responses are proffered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Management of Fever in Infants and Young Children.
PG  - 721-729
AB  - Despite dramatic reductions in the rates of bacteremia and meningitis since the 1980s, febrile illness in children younger than 36 months continues to be a concern with potentially serious consequences. Factors that suggest serious infection include age younger than one month, poor arousability, petechial rash, delayed capillary refill, increased respiratory effort, and overall physician assessment. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three years, so evaluation for such infections should be performed in those with unexplained fever. Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for invasive bacterial infections, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, when available, are more informative. Chest radiography is rarely recommended for children older than 28 days in the absence of localizing signs. Lumbar puncture is not recommended for children older than three months without localizing signs, it may also be considered for those from one to three months of age with abnormal laboratory test results. Protocols such as Step-by-Step, Laboratory Score, or the Rochester algorithms may be helpful in identifying low-risk patients. Rapid influenza testing and tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be of value when those diseases are circulating. When empiric treatment is appropriate, suggested antibiotics include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for infants one to three months of age and ampicillin with gentamicin or with cefotaxime for neonates. For children three months to three years of age, azithromycin or amoxicillin is recommended if pneumonia is suspected, for urinary infections, suggested antibiotics are cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Choice of antibiotics should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance.

LID - 10.1111/hir.12319 [doi]
AB  - The 2020 virtual issue of the Health Information and Libraries Journal (HILJ) is published to link to the CILIP Health Libraries Group Conference which was to take place in Scotland 22-25th July. Whilst the conference was postponed in light of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, its themes of (i) Working in Partnership, (ii) Resilience and Well-being, (iii) Public and Patient involvement, (iv) Quality Impact and Metrics, and (v) Improvement and Innovation have nevertheless provided the basis on which to compile this virtual issue. Overarching these themes is a core value of the HIL profession, to provide relevant, timely and sustainable information services, and the articles selected from HILJ (2018 through to March 2020) contribute to the aim of meeting and going beyond these goals under the conference banner of 'not your average day in the office'. The virtual issue mirrors the format of a regular issue of HILJ, a review article, four original articles and three from our regular features: 'Dissertations into Practice', 'International Perspectives and Initiatives' and 'Teaching and Learning in Action'. The authors come from Canada, China, Croatia, Sweden and the UK. All articles included in this issue are available online.

AB  - Cases of COVID-19 have been reported in neonates, and although these were either asymptomatic or non-severe [1], it is apparent that obstetricians are at increased risk of infection. As a result, safety procedures must be reinforced by ensuring the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the application of infection control measures [2].

PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/08959420.2020.1777826 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 economic crisis makes it vitally important that workers who earned defined benefit pensions receive them at retirement. Unfortunately, billions of dollars that could help cushion the financial shock are sitting unclaimed, because the people who they belong to cannot locate the company responsible for paying them. As defined benefit pension plans have been terminated, merged and moved over the years, large numbers of deferred vested participants have not been notified about their benefits. The widespread and growing practice of insurance company pension buy-outs can be especially problematic for participants without notice. Broader use of electronic disclosures for pensions also threatens to make the situation worse. In the wake of COVID-19, policy makers should take steps to ensure that pension benefits are part of the economic recovery.

PG  - 1372-1378
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1775499 [doi]
AB  - Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as pandemic and public health emergency that infected more than 5 million people worldwide at the time of writing this protocol. Strong evidence for the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 has not been published in Africa. Therefore, this protocol will be served as a guideline to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa. Methods: Published and unpublished studies on the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa and written in any language will be included. Databases (PubMed / MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, EMBASE, Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochran Library, Africa Wide Knowledge, and Africa Index Medicus) from December 2019 to May 2020 will be searched. Two independent reviewers will select, screen, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. The proportion will be measured using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis will be conducted to manage hetrogeinity. The presence of publication bias will be assessed using Egger's test and visual inspection of the funnel plots. This systematic and meta-analysis review protocol will be reported per the PRISMA-P guidelines. Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will be expected to quantify the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa. Systematic review registration: This protocol was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in March 2020 and accepted with the registration number: CRD42020179321(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2020.1777904 [doi]
AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is a novel human Coronavirus that is responsible for about 300,000 deaths worldwide. To date, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine prevention strategy against COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatment, drug repurposing is regarded as the immediate option. Potential drugs can often be identified via in silico drug screening experiments. Consequently, there has been an explosion of in silico experiments to find drug candidates or investigate anecdotal claims. One drug with several anecdotal accounts of benefit is Cefuroxime. The aim of this study was to identify and summarize in silico evidence for possible activity of Cefuroxime against SARS-CoV-2.To this end, we performed a scoping review of literature of in silico drug repurposing experiments for SARS-CoV-2 using PRISMA-ScR. We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar for original studies published between 1st Feb, 2020 and 15th May, 2020 that screened drug libraries, and identified Cefuroxime as a top-ranked potential inhibitor drug against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Six studies were identified. These studies reported Cefuroxime as a potential inhibitor of 3 key SARS-CoV-2 proteins, main protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and ACE2-Spike complex. We provided a summary of the methodology and findings of the identified studies. Our scoping review identified significant in silico evidence that Cefuroxime may be a potential multi-target inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to evaluate the potential of Cefuroxime for COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Possible therapeutic agents for COVID-19: a comprehensive review.
LID - 10.1080/14787210.2020.1782742 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China. There are no available vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19 patients. Herein, we represented possible therapeutic agents that may stand as a potential therapy against COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov for relevant papers. We showed some agents with potentially favorable efficacy, acceptable safety as well as good pharmacokinetic profiles. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. However, some drugs were withdrawn due to their side effects after demonstrating some clinical efficacy. Indeed, the most effective therapies could be organ function support, convalescent plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies, especially anti-influenza drugs due to the similarities between respiratory viruses regarding viral entry, uncoating, and replication. We encourage giving more attention to favipiravir, remdesivir, and measles vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: A combination, at least dual or even triple therapy, of the aforementioned efficacious and safe therapies is greatly recommended for COVID-19. Further, patients should have a routine assessment for their coagulation and bleeding profiles as well as their inflammatory and cytokine concentrations.

TI  - Contraception and reproductive planning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2020.1782738 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. Major disruption to healthcare services during the current COVID 19 pandemic will last even after its peak. Sexual and reproductive health (SRH), specially contraception, needs to be understood as an essential service. AREAS COVERED: This paper is a narrative review. Data from PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and websites of scientific societies were screened during the months of April and May 2020. It addresses the main aspects related to contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on family planning services, extended use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, drug interactions and thromboembolism risk. We also specified some issues focused on the Brazilian reality. EXPERT OPINION: Ensuring proper contraception use in the COVID-19 time is very important. We encourage women, healthcare providers, policy makers, and the society to consider SRH services as priority.

AB  - We present the case of a critically ill 47-year-old man diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who developed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas in conjunction with an acute abdomen during the recovery phase of his acute lung injury. A non-surgical conservative approach was taken as the definitive surgical procedure, a complete small-bowel resection was deemed to be associated with an unacceptably high long-term morbidity. However, repeat computed tomography four days later showed complete resolution of the original computed tomography findings. Pneumatosis intestinalis from non-ischaemic origins has been described in association with norovirus and cytomegalovirus. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been described in COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aims to analyze the status quo of public health emergency measures taken in China in dealing with the spread of new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and to put forward policy suggestions for system construction and improvement. METHODS: According to the official data released by the National Health Commission, the epidemic data of infected people from 0:00 on January 24, 2020 to 24:00 on February 23, 2020 were quantitatively analyzed through statistical analysis. We used EXCEL software to draw the overall epidemic trend chart and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) to carry out descriptive statistical analysis of mortality and cure rate. We made qualitative analysis on the emergency measures implemented by national administrative departments and provincial governments to work on controlling and monitoring COVID-19 nationwide spread. RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed showed a linear increasing trend, with the slope increasing first and decreasing later. Suspected and new cases showed an inverted V pattern, with the peak occurring on February 8 and 12, respectively. There was a linear increase in the number of deaths and an exponential increase in the number of cures. Over the 31-day study period, the mortality rate fluctuated between 2.0% and 3.4%. The mean cure rate was 10.03%, the minimum value was 1.33%, and the maximum value was 32.05%. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the public health emergency response system constructed in China plays a significant role in controlling the epidemic in a certain period of time. DISCUSSION: The four-tier emergency management system and the joint prevention mechanism established in China have provided various resources to control the epidemic, but there are still weakness in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. It is suggested to improve and strengthen the emergency management system, public health service system, health legal system, citizen health education, and international exchange and cooperation.

AB  - Turkey reported its first COVID-19 case on March 10, 2020. We present here the mitigation efforts Turkey has undertaken so far, and also review the lessons learned for future proactive strategies. High number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, national treatment algorithms, governmental support for free testing and medications, tedious contact-tracing with early detection and isolation of cases together with early shelter-in-place for the elderly and youngsters, and subsequent weekend curfews in selected cities have so far prevented the surge pressure on the health care system. At this phase, Turkey needs to adopt an evidence-based, proactive control system for an effective transition process to normalize the situation. Here, we underline the urgent need for detailed analysis of the national COVID-19 data and propose an epidemiologic investigation framework for better understanding, efficient control, and reliable forecasting of COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe clinical effect of heat-sensitive moxibustion on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to discusses the effective moxibustion treatment program. METHODS: A total of 42 patients with COVID-19 (general type) were treated with heat-sensitive moxibustion at the acupoint area of Shenque (CV 8) and Tianshu (ST 25). The treatment was conducted under the standards of heat-sensitive moxibustion manipulation, which were "locating acupoint by feeling, moxibustion by differentiate sensation, dosage varies individually, ending after sufficient dosage". The incidence of deqi after first heat-sensitive moxibustion, the reduction of negative emotions, the improvement of chest distress and impaired appetite, and the active acceptance rate of moxibustion before and after treatment were observed. RESULTS:   The deqi rate of heat-sensitive moxibustion for 20 min,40 min,1 h were respectively 52.4% (22/42), 90.5% (38/42), 100.0% (42/42).   The incidences of feeling relaxed and comfortable immediately after the first, second, and third heat-sensitive moxibustion were 61.9% (26/42), 73.8% (31/42), and 92.9% (39/42), which were higher than 42.9% (18/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion treatment (P<0.05).   The incidences of chest distress after the first, second, and third heat-sensitive moxibustion were 23.8% (10/42), 16.7% (7/42), and 9.5% (4/42), which were lower than 50.0% (21/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion treatment (P<0.05), the incidences of impaired appetite after the first, second, and third heat-sensitive moxibustion were 26.2% (11/42), 19.0% (8/42), 9.5% (4/42), which were lower than 57.1% (24/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion treatment (P<0.05).   After the first treatment, the active acceptance rate of patients for heat-sensitive moxibustion was 100.0% (42/42), which was higher than 11.9% (5/42) before heat-sensitive moxibustion (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The heat-sensitive moxibustion can effectively reduce the negative emotions and improve the symptoms of chest distress and impaired appetite with COVID-19. It is generally accepted by patients, and worthy of popularization and application in clinical treatment.

AB  - Acupuncture and moxibustion has a wealth of experience in the prevention and control of epidemic disease since ancient times, which was used for all kinds of acute infectious diseases in modern times and its efficacy has been clearly and reliably reported. This article proposes the theoretical feasibility and reliability of acupuncture and moxibustion interventional prevention and treatment by discussing the recognition of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the perspective of acupuncture and moxibustion. The unique "acupuncture and moxibustion program" for COVID-19 is presented including treatment in different stages, selecting acupoints by distinguishing meridians, applying needle technique by various methods. The article also proposes a new understanding of acupuncture and moxibustion at related acupoints on the surface of the body that can directly affect the "moyuan" to treat the disease.

TI  - Age Related Morbidity and Mortality among Patients with COVID-19.
AB  - On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease has been uncovered. Understanding the spectrum of illness and the pathogenic mechanism of the disease in a vulnerable population is critical, especially during the pandemic. Herein, we reviewed published COVID-19 epidemiology data from several countries to identify any consistent trends in the relationship between age and COVID-19-associated morbidity or mortality. We also reviewed the literature for studies explaining the difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection according to age. The insights from these data will be useful in determining the treatment policies and preventive measures of COVID-19.

TI  - A Pathophysiological Perspective on COVID-19's Lethal Complication: From Viremia to Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis-like Immune Dysregulation.
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for our recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, is driving a lung immunopathology that strongly resembles a severe form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). A review of recent Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 medical reports, as well as described characteristics of HP, lead us to postulate a theory for SARS-CoV-2 severe disease. We propose that the novel SARS-CoV-2 can act as a trigger and substrate of an HP-like severe immune reaction especially in genetically vulnerable individuals in addition to those with immune senescence and dysregulation. Accordingly, the purpose of our letter is to shift the emphasis of concern surrounding immune activity from viral infection to an HP-like severe immune reaction. We review similarities in disease presentation between infection and allergy, relevant immunopathology, and outline phases of SARS-CoV-2 disease with perspectives on therapy and critical care. Altogether, the favored course is to begin treatments that address the disease at the earliest phase before immune dysregulation leading to uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation.

PG  - e223
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mortality risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher in patients with older age, and many elderly patients are reported to require advanced respiratory support. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 98 patients aged >= 65 years who were hospitalized with COVID-19 during a regional outbreak in Daegu/Gyeongsangbuk-do province of Korea. The outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and the treatment with mechanical ventilation (MV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 72 years, 55.1% were female. Most (74.5%) had at least one underlying condition. Overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 20.4%, and median time to death after admission was 8 days. The CFR was 6.1% among patients aged 65-69 years, 22.7% among those aged 70-79 years, and 38.1% among those aged >= 80 years. The CFR among patients who required MV was 43.8%, and the proportion of patients received MV/HFNC was 28.6%. Nosocomial acquisition, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, and chronic neurologic diseases were significant risk factors for both death and MV/HFNC. Hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status on admission were also associated with poor outcome. CRP > 8.0 mg/dL was strongly associated with MV/HFNC (odds ratio, 26.31, 95% confidence interval, 7.78-88.92, P < 0.001), and showed better diagnostic characteristics compared to commonly used clinical scores. CONCLUSION: Patients aged >= 80 years had a high risk of requiring MV/HFNC, and mortality among those severe patients was very high. Severe initial presentation and laboratory abnormalities, especially high CRP, were identified as risk factors for mortality and severe hospital course.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The absence of effective antiviral medications and vaccines increased the focus on non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors for mitigating against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To examine the current status of non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors practiced during the COVID-19 outbreak and factors affecting behavioral activities, we compared to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea. METHODS: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 (MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged >= 18 years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected post-stratification by sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing transmission-reducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and handwashing. RESULTS: Between the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social distancing increased from 41.9%-58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%-92.3% (COVID-19). The response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%. Practicing transmission-reducing behaviors (wearing face masks and handwashing) at least once during COVID-19 (78.8%, 80.2%) also increased compared to that during MERS-CoV (15.5%, 60.3%). The higher affective risk perception groups were more likely to practice transmission-reducing measures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24-4.81, 95 confidence interval, 1.76-6.96) during both COVID-19 and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest markedly increased proportions of non-pharmaceutical behavioral practices evenly across all subgroups during the two different novel virus outbreaks in Korea. Strategic interventions are needed to attempt based on preventive behavior works.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its first detection in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has spread rapidly around the world. Although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for severe COVID-19, there have been no such studies in Korea. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, Korea. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Severe disease was defined as a composite outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit care, or death. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 19.15, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-193.42, P = 0.012), body temperature >= 37.8°C (OR, 10.91, 95% CI, 1.35-88.36, P = 0.025), peripheral oxygen saturation < 92% (OR, 33.31, 95% CI, 2.45-452.22, P = 0.008), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) > 6.3 (OR, 56.84, 95% CI, 2.64-1,223.78, P = 0.010) at admission were associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. The likelihood of development of severe COVID-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that diabetes mellitus, body temperature >= 37.8°C, peripheral oxygen saturation < 92%, and CK-MB > 6.3 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Appropriate assessment of prognostic factors and close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the appropriate time in high-risk patients may reduce the case fatality rate of COVID-19.

LID - 10.1111/dth.13833 [doi]
AB  - In the era of staggering speed in development of the novel coronavirus (CoV) pandemic (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), we have reviewed the dermatologists' tools at hand for their utility (and potential risks) in patients affected by COVID-19. This review aims to shed light on the anti-viral and pro-viral potential of drugs routinely used in dermatology to modulate COVID-19. The literature search included peer-reviewed articles published in English language (clinical trials or scientific reviews). Studies were identified by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE and PubMed) from January 1990 to March 2020 and by reference lists of respective articles. Somewhat to our surprise, we have found that several of our drugs widely used in dermatology have antiviral potential. On the other hand, we also frequently use immunosuppressive drugs in our dermatologic patients that potentially pose them at increased risk for COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between the anxiety states and knowledge levels of female midwifery students about COVID-19 during the outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study carried out with online participation of 972 female midwifery students. FINDINGS: The anxiety levels of the female midwifery students were high among those visiting the hospital during the pandemic and having parents or relatives who had chronic diseases. Female midwifery students had a high level of knowledge regarding COVID-19. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Female midwives of the future will take part in primary health care services in the protection and promotion of health as an important occupational group in the public health system. To determine mental health and psychological needs of them during the outbreak will greatly contribute to the pandemic management process.

TI  - YouTube as a source of patient information for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A content-quality and audience engagement analysis.
PG  - e2132
LID - 10.1002/rmv.2132 [doi]
AB  - YouTube is the second most popular website in the world and is increasingly being used as a platform for disseminating health information. Our aim was to evaluate the content-quality and audience engagement of YouTube videos pertaining to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 virus which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), during the early phase of the pandemic. We chose the first 30 videos for seven different search phrases: "2019 nCoV," "SARS CoV-2," "COVID-19 virus," "coronavirus treatment," "coronavirus explained," "what is the coronavirus" and "coronavirus information." Video contents were evaluated by two independent medical students with more than 5 years of experience using the DISCERN instrument. Qualitative data, quantitative data and upload source for each video was noted for a quality and audience engagement analysis. Out of the total 210 videos, 137 met our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The mean DISCERN score was 31.33 out of 75 possible points, which indicates that the quality of YouTube videos on COVID-19 is currently poor. There was excellent reliability between the two raters (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). 55% of the videos discussed prevention, 49% discussed symptoms and 46% discussed the spread of the virus. Most of the videos were uploaded by news channels (50%) and education channels (40%). The quality of YouTube videos on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is poor, however, we have listed the top-quality videos in our article as they may be effective tools for patient education during the pandemic.

LID - 10.1007/s11701-020-01100-8 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been a life-changing experience for both individuals and institutions. We describe changes in our practice based on real-time assessment of various national and international trends of COVID-19 and its effectiveness in the management of our resources. Initial risk assessment and peak resource requirement using the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) and McKinsey models. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of our practice's approach during the pandemic. Based on CHIME the community followed 60% social distancing, the number of expected new patients hospitalized at maximum surge would be 401, with 100 patients requiring ventilator support. In contrast, when the community followed 15% social distancing, the maximum surge of hospitalized new patients would be 1823 and 455 patients would require a ventilator. on April 15, the expected May requirement of ICU beds at peak would be 68, with 61 patients needing ventilators. The estimated surge numbers improved throughout April, and on April 22 the expected ICU bed peak in May would be 11.7, and those requiring ventilator would be 10.5. Simultaneously, within a month, our surgical waitlist grew from 585 to over 723 patients. Our SWOT analysis revealed our internal strengths and inherent weakness, relevant to the pandemic. A graded and a guarded response to this type of situation is crucial in managing patients in a large practice.

TI  - PPIs and Beyond: A Framework for Managing Anticoagulation-Related Gastrointestinal Bleeding in the Era of COVID-19.
LID - 10.1007/s10620-020-06408-x [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) can be associated with high morbidity and mortality, patients with severe clinical manifestations may develop significant coagulopathy as well as unexpected thromboembolic complications. In response, centers are increasingly treating selected patients with intermediate-dose prophylactic or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation in order to prevent potentially catastrophic thrombotic complications. With this changing practice, the authors suspect that inpatient gastrointestinal consult teams across the country will be frequently managing COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). In order to reduce potentially avoidable hospital readmissions for GIB while improving patient outcomes, it is imperative to appropriately risk-stratify patients prior to initiation of anticoagulation. In this review, we discuss how to appropriately identify high-risk patients for GIB and how to mitigate GIB risk with proton-pump inhibitor co-therapy, medication reconciliation, and Helicobacter pylori testing and treating in this complex and morbid population.

TI  - The case for a 3rd generation supraglottic airway device facilitating direct vision placement.
LID - 10.1007/s10877-020-00537-4 [doi]
AB  - Although 1st and 2nd generation supraglottic airway devices (SADs) have many desirable features, they are nevertheless inserted in a similar 'blind' way as their 1st generation predecessors. Clinicians mostly still rely entirely on subjective indirect assessments to estimate correct placement which supposedly ensures a tight seal. Malpositioning and potential airway compromise occurs in more than half of placements. Vision-guided insertion can improve placement. In this article we propose the development of a 3rd generation supraglottic airway device, equipped with cameras and fiberoptic illumination, to visualise insertion of the device, enable immediate manoeuvres to optimise SAD position, verify whether correct 1st and 2nd seals are achieved and check whether size selected is appropriate. We do not provide technical details of such a '3rd generation' device, but rather present a theoretical analysis of its desirable properties, which are essential to overcome the remaining limitations of current 1st and 2nd generation devices. We also recommend that this further milestone improvement, i.e. ability to place the SAD accurately under direct vision, be eligible for the moniker '3rd generation'. Blind insertion of SADs should become the exception and we anticipate, as in other domains such as central venous cannulation and nerve block insertions, vision-guided placement becoming the gold standard.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on thyroid cancer surgery and adjunct therapy.
LID - 10.1007/s13304-020-00833-3 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has profoundly modified the way healthcare is delivered. Jordan imposed lockdown and restrictive policies between March 17 and May 20, 2020. We aimed to assess the impact of such measures on thyroid cancer treatment plans. In the specified period, 12 patients were scheduled for surgery. Since papillary carcinoma was the preoperative diagnosis in all cases, radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) therapy was also planned 3-4 weeks following surgery after withdrawing thyroxine and achieving a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level > 30 mU/L. Thyroxine withdrawal is the routine method applied for RIA in Jordan as it is less costly compared to the rapid method of exogenous stimulation using recombinant TSH. All surgical procedures were performed without delay since all patients were asymptomatic per flu-like illness and came from a region of low COVID-19 prevalence. These included total thyroidectomy (n = 11), bilateral therapeutic central compartment neck dissection (n = 7), lateral compartment neck dissection (n = 5). However, the RIA treatment plan was altered considerably according to the period in which they were operated. 6 out of the 7 patients operated in March changed to the stimulated method of RIA at a considerable additional extra cost. The seventh patient and the April patient opt to delay RIA until after lockdown. The remaining cases (operated in May) followed the usual withdrawal method as restrictions were due to an end. The restrictive measures applied during COVID-19 did not affect the safe and timely delivery of surgical care. However, it added a financial and psychological burden to the entire cancer management plan.

TI  - Impaired cardiac function is associated with mortality in patients with acute COVID-19 infection.
LID - 10.1007/s00392-020-01683-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection may cause severe respiratory distress and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Impaired cardiac function and/or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be associated with poor prognosis. In the present study, we report a comprehensive cardiovascular characterization in the first consecutive collective of patients that was admitted and treated at the University Hospital of Tübingen, Germany. METHODS: 123 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included. Routine blood sampling, transthoracic echocardiography and electrocardiography were performed at hospital admission. RESULTS: We found that impaired left-ventricular and right-ventricular function as well as tricuspid regurgitation > grade 1 were significantly associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, elevated levels of myocardial distress markers (troponin-I and NT pro-BNP) were associated with poor prognosis in this patient collective. CONCLUSION: Impaired cardiac function is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 positive patients. Consequently, treatment of these patients should include careful guideline-conform cardiovascular evaluation and treatment. Thus, formation of a competent Cardio-COVID-19 team may represent a major clinical measure to optimize therapy of cardiovascular patients during this pandemic.

TI  - Genitourinary cancer management during a severe pandemic: Utility of rapid communication tools and evidence-based guidelines.
PG  - 45-59
LID - 10.1002/bco2.18 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the usefulness of social media for rapid communication with experts to discuss strategies for prioritization and safety of deferred treatment for urologic malignancies during COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine whether the discourse and recommendations made through discussions on social media (Twitter) were consistent with the current peer-reviewed literature regarding the safety of delayed treatment. METHODS: We reviewed and compiled the responses to our questions on Twitter regarding the management and safety of deferred treatment in the setting of COVID-19 related constraints on non-urgent care. We chronicled the guidance published on this subject by various health authorities and professional organizations. Further, we analyzed peerreviewed literature on the safety of deferred treatment (surgery or systemic therapy) to make made evidence-based recommendations. RESULTS: Due to the rapidly changing information about epidemiology and infectious characteristics of COVID-19, the health authorities and professional societies guidance required frequent revisions which by design take days or weeks to produce. Several active discussions on Twitter provided real-time updates on the changing landscape of the restrictions being placed on non-urgent care. For separate discussion threads on prostate cancer and bladder cancer, dozens of specialists with expertise in treating urologic cancers could be engaged in providing their expert opinions as well as share evidence to support their recommendations. Our analysis of published studies addressing the safety and extent to which delayed cancer care does not compromise oncological outcome revealed that most prostate cancer care and certain aspects of the bladder and kidney cancer care can be safely deferred for 2-6 months. Urothelial bladder cancer and advanced kidney cancer require a higher priority for timely surgical care. We did not find evidence to support the idea of using nonsurgical therapies, such as hormone therapy for prostate cancer or chemotherapy for bladder cancer for safer deferment of previously planned surgery. We noted that the comments and recommendations made by the participants in the Twitter discussions were generally consistent with our evidence-based recommendations for safely postponing cancer care for certain types of urologic cancers. CONCLUSION: The use of social media platforms, such as Twitter, where the comments and recommendations are subject to review and critique by other specialists is not only feasible but quite useful in addressing the situations requiring urgent resolution, often supported by published evidence. In circumstances such as natural disasters, this may be a preferable approach than the traditional expert panels due to its ability to harness the collective intellect to available experts to provide responses and solutions in real-time. These real-time communications via Twitter provided sound guidance which was readily available to the public and participants, and was generally in concordance with the peerreviewed data on safety of deferred treatment.

AB  - When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared, it was clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) would have far-reaching impacts on medicine, society and everyday life. As a junior doctor working closely with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, I was aware of my personal risk of exposure to the virus. I assumed that as a fit and well 26-year-old with no comorbidities, if I were to become infected, it was unlikely that COVID-19 would be severe. However, I became critically unwell following a week of clinical work, necessitating hospital admission, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. I remained mechanically ventilated for 6 days and was then transferred to a medical ward 2 days later. After two further days of rehabilitation, I was discharged home. This reflection is not a junior doctor's view of how COVID-19 was managed by the NHS, but a personal view of my illness from 'the other side of the curtain'. My reflections focus upon the psychological aspects of my experiences, exploring the memories that I formed around the time of critical care, how the fears that I possessed were managed with exceptional communication, and the importance of the wider healthcare team in my recovery.

PG  - 100052

AB  - Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan, COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world and poses a serious threat to public health. Acute respiratory failure due to widespread lung inflammation progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with an altered pulmonary and alveolar function that can lead to disability, prolong hospitalizations, and adverse outcomes. While there is no specific treatment for severe acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS due to the COVID-19 and the management is mostly supportive, it is very important to better understand the pathophysiological processes activated by the inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and metalloproteinases with the aim of their subsequent inhibition in the course of the complex treatment. Herein, we will discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of ALI/ARDS, with a focus on the pivotal role played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS), and the effects of the possible pharmacological interventions. Aprotinin is a nonspecific protease inhibitor especially of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and kallikrein, and it is many years in clinical use. Aprotinin inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and involved in the process of glycoprotein homeostasis. Experimental data support that the use of aprotinin to inhibit MMPs and KKS may be a new potential approach to the treatment of ALI / ARDS.

AB  - On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded the status of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak from epidemic to a global pandemic. This infection is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Several rapid diagnostic tests have been developed at an astonishing pace, however, COVID-19 requires more highly specific rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. This review describes the currently available testing approaches, as well as the available test assays including the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test (takes (~)45 min) and Abbott ID COVID-19 test (5 min) as easy to use point-of-care tests for diagnosis of novel COVID-19 that have so far received the US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorizations clearance. This review is correct as of the date published and will be updated as more diagnostic tests come to light.

TI  - EEG findings in acutely ill patients investigated for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19: A small case series preliminary report.
PG  - 314-324
LID - 10.1002/epi4.12399 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute encephalopathy may occur in COVID-19-infected patients. We investigated whether medically indicated EEGs performed in acutely ill patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 report epileptiform abnormalities and whether these are more prevalent in COVID-19 positive than negative patients. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, adult COVID-19 inpatient PUIs underwent EEGs for acute encephalopathy and/or seizure-like events. PUIs had 8-channel headband EEGs (Ceribell, 20 COVID-19 positive, 6 COVID-19 negative), 2 more COVID-19 patients had routine EEGs. Overall, 26 Ceribell EEGs, 4 routine and 7 continuous EEG studies were reviewed. EEGs were interpreted by board-certified clinical neurophysiologists (n = 16). EEG findings were correlated with demographic data, clinical presentation and history, and medication usage. Fisher's exact test was used. RESULTS: We included 28 COVID-19 PUIs (30-83 years old), of whom 22 tested positive (63.6% males) and 6 tested negative (33.3% male). The most common indications for EEG, among COVID-19-positive vs COVID-19-negative patients, respectively, were new onset encephalopathy (68.2% vs 33.3%) and seizure-like events (14/22, 63.6%, 2/6, 33.3%), even among patients without prior history of seizures (11/17, 64.7%, 2/6, 33.3%). Sporadic epileptiform discharges (EDs) were present in 40.9% of COVID-19-positive and 16.7% of COVID-19-negative patients, frontal sharp waves were reported in 8/9 (88.9%) of COVID-19-positive patients with EDs and in 1/1 of COVID-19-negative patient with EDs. No electrographic seizures were captured, but 19/22 COVID-19-positive and 6/6 COVID-19-negative patients were given antiseizure medications and/or sedatives before the EEG. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first preliminary report of EDs in the EEG of acutely ill COVID-19-positive patients with encephalopathy or suspected clinical seizures. EDs are relatively common in this cohort and typically appear as frontal sharp waves. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the potential direct or indirect effects of COVID-19 on activating epileptic activity.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19, and has caused high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Empirical models are useful tools to predict future trends of disease progression such as COVID-19 over the near-term. A modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model was developed to predict the progression of infectious disease outbreaks. The modification allows for the production of precise daily estimates, which are critical during a pandemic of this scale for planning purposes. The m-IDEA model was employed using a range of serial intervals given the lack of knowledge on the true serial interval of COVID-19. Both deterministic and stochastic approaches were applied. Model fitting was accomplished through minimizing the sum-of-square differences between predicted and observed daily incidence case counts, and performance was retrospectively assessed. The performance of the m-IDEA for projection cases in the near-term was improved using shorter serial intervals (1-4 days) at early stages of the pandemic, and longer serial intervals at mid- to late-stages (5-9 days) thus far. This, coupled with epidemiological reports, suggests that the serial interval of COVID-19 might increase as the pandemic progresses, which is rather intuitive: Increasing serial intervals can be attributed to gradual increases in public health interventions such as facility closures, public caution and social distancing, thus increasing the time between transmission events. In most cases, the stochastic approach captured the majority of future reported incidence data, because it accounts for the uncertainty around the serial interval of COVID-19. As such, it is the preferred approach for using the m-IDEA during dynamic situation such as in the midst of a major pandemic.

TI  - Impact of coronavirus pandemic crisis in endoscopic clinical practice: Results from a national survey in Brazil.

AB  - Background and study aims  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, mobilizing all countries to contain the disease spread. Activity in endoscopy centers globally was severely affected. We conducted a national survey aiming to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on endoscopic clinical practice in Brazil. Methods  In April 2020, 3,719 associate members of SOBED (Brazilian Society of Digestive Endoscopy) were invited to respond to an electronic survey. An Internet link was established to provide access to the online questionnaire with 40 questions regarding personal profile, endoscopy unit logistics and schedule, availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), financial impact, and exposure to COVID-19. Results  A total of 2,131 individuals (67 %) accessed the questionnaire and 1155 responses were received. After review, 980 responses were considered valid. According to almost 90 % of respondents, endoscopy activity was restricted to urgent procedures, in both public and private hospitals. All respondents increased PPE use after the outbreak, however, institutions provided adequate PPE to only 278 responders (28.7 %). Significant income loss was universally reported. A total of 10 practitioners (1 %) reported COVID-19 infection and attributed the contamination to endoscopic procedures. Conclusions  Based on this nationwide survey with almost 1,000 respondents, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced the activity of endoscopy units in private and public settings. The pandemic increased awareness of PPE use, but its availability was not universal and 1 % of the respondents became infected with COVID-19, allegedly due to exposure during endoscopic procedures.
